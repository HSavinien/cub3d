main loop function :
	calculate the angle for each pixel column, store it in an array.
	for each angle : 
		call ray function;
	display image;
	add other images (minimap, hud...);



claculating each angle : 
	min angle is player_dir - fov/2
	max angle is player_dir + fov/2
	interval between two successive number is (max - min)/fov
	calculate each number in this interval and store in array;

ray function
